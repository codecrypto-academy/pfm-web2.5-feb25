# Part 1
## Script for automatic creation of a Besu network


## Requirements  
- **Operating System**: The script is designed to work on Linux and macOS-based systems (it can also be run on Windows if you have a Bash-compatible environment, such as WSL).  
- **Dependencies**:  
  - **Node.js**: Helper scripts are programmed with JS, to run them you must have the Node.js enviroment.
  - **Docker**: This script uses a container based approach to create each of the network nodes.  
  - **Git**: To clone the repository.

## Installation  

### Clone the Repository  

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidGalaviz/pfm-web2.5-feb25.git
```

### Install Dependencies  

Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If you don’t have it, you can follow the installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).  

# Script  
## createBESUnetwork.sh  
The `createBESUnetwork.sh` script automates the creation of a BESU network (Ethereum client compatible with testnets and Mainnet).  

### Running the Script  

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project folder and make the script executable:

```bash
cd pfm-web2.5-feb25
chmod +x createBESUnetwork.sh
```

### Executing the Script  

The script accepts the following commands:  
- **createBesuNetwork** | Creates a BESU network  
- **deleteBesuNetwork** | Deletes a BESU network (Not yet implemented)  
- **addBesuNode** | Adds a node to an existing BESU network (Not yet implemented)  
- **deleteBesuNode** | Removes a node from an existing BESU network (Not yet implemented)  

#### Example Usage:  
```bash
./createBESUnetwork.sh createBesuNetwork
```

### Command createBesuNetwork  
This command in the `createBESUnetwork.sh` script creates a Besu network using Clique PoA.

The script allows you to configure the following:  

- **Chain ID**  
- **Number of nodes**: The number of nodes you want in the BESU network.  
- **Network name**: The name you want to assign to the network being created.  
- **Network IP**  
- **Number of bootnodes**  
- **Directory**: The directory where a folder for the network will be created.  

### Example Usage:  
This command will create a BESU network called "TEST" with 4 nodes.
